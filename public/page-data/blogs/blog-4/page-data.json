We will consider four main topics here, these are;\n\n+ Speaking \n+ Listening\n+ Writing\n+ Reading\n\n### Speaking\n\nIn order to improve my English speaking practice, I take private lessons 2 days a week, half an hour a day. In our meeting, we talk about everyday topics and general interview questions. If you want to take a private lesson for speaking practice, you can contact me. Other suggestions for speaking practice.\n\n+ Expand your vocabulary\n+ Improve your pronunciation\n+ Learn the natural flow of English\n+ Build English speaking confidence\n+ Speech shadowing\n+ Self-talk\n+ Think in English\n+ Retell a story in English\n+ Participate in public speaking events\n+ Go to language cafes\n+ Using apps\n+ Chat with Siri\n\n### Listening\n\nI improve my English listening ability, by following English courses and training related to my department and I have made it a habit. Watching a tutorial in English helps us learn their pronunciation. In addition, if there are things that I do not understand, especially while listening, I look up their meanings and pronunciation using google translate.\n\n### Writing\n\nI love taking notes while learning something new and I keep my notes sometimes in English. In this way, I have improved my English both in writing and technically. I have been writing articles on my blog for one month. This both excites me and causes me to constantly keep myself alive for writing in English. Finally, I use Cambridge Grammar education book series to improve my writing and reading skills.\n\n### Reading\n\n\n\n### Helpful resources\n\n+ [How to Improve Your English-Speaking Skills](https://www.fluentu.com/blog/english/how-to-improve-english-speaking-skills/)","title":"Blog 4","desc":"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
